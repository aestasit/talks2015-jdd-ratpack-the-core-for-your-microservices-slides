# Ratpack: Core of your micro-services

Slide deck of presentation "**Ratpack: Core of your micro-services**" given at **JDD** (Krakow), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> Ratpack reached version 1.0 in 2015. Itâ€™s a light-weight framework with a lot of potential. It has a good team and years for coding behind it, but still remains very straight-forward, easy to use, deploy, extend and at the same time it's very efficient and performing. Its core is non-blocking and implements reactive approaches for handling high-load with little resources. It has all you need for your micro-services.
